# ISTA 131 Dealing With Data

For the rest of the semester, ISTA 131 will focus on helping you develop an intuition for data.  In other words, given some data, what can we learn about our world?  Since I'm a physical scientist, many of our examples will be from the natural world, but the same principles apply to business, biological sciences, economics, etc.  We need tools to deal with data and Python's go-to data science tool is pandas, so we will focus on pandas and companion modules from here on in.

 

## Homework

 

Collaboration on homeworks is allowed.  Looping is allowed on homework 4 for all functions.  It is required that you state in your documentation who you collaborated with if you work with others.  Wholesale appropriation of someone else's code will not get you any points if we pick up on it, but you can work together. 

 

The grades for the first two homeworks are rough.  My philosophy of homework is that it's part of the learning process and it should be possible to get 100% on every homework with a reasonable amount of effort.  Tests are where we assess how much you have learned.  So we will take the average of your homework grades for the rest of the semester and replace any grades from the first four homeworks with that average if those grades were less than the second half average.  I will release the homework grades shortly, but I want everyone to have a chance to see this before they go up.

 

You can submit a homework up to 24 hours late for a 10% penalty.  If you get less than 70% on a homework, you can ask me and I will let you redo it for a small penalty.  So effectively, you can always submit old homeworks, but getting far behind is the kiss of death in classes like this.

 

## Midterm

 

The last day to drop with a W is November 3, so the midterm will be on October 31 (Halloween).  That way, you will have done two pandas homeworks and we can assess how well your first stab at learning this critical skill is going. 

 

Announcements and Getting Help

 

Announcements will be through D2L Announcements.  Help will be through the listserv.  Please attach your code when you ask questions.  You can discuss with each other on piazza (don't post code), but that is not where the action will take place.  Start your homeworks early because there is no guarantee that someone will be answering questions on Thursday night.
